## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Continent outlines as SVG path data in GlobeView (keeps globe self-contained in chats.tsx)
- Proportional shrink (not drop) for collision resolution (preserves all rooms visible)
- Email OTP + Google OAuth (no password — simpler onboarding)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Gesture responder state machine in chats.tsx is fragile — zero test coverage. Globe and collision changes both touch this file. Proceed carefully, one phase at a time.
- useNativeDriver: false is required on sky canvas; do not change this when modifying animations.
